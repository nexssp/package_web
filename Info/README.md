![MessageBox](assets/console-table-display-example-nexss.png?raw=true "This message box appears through PowerShell and pass data to nodeJS!")

Nexss System allow to run systems in many languages at once. In this case:

- We use PowerShell script `getWebInfo.ps1` to get the data by the docker and great tool `wappalyzer/cli`.
- We parse the data by the nodeJS/JavaScript and display it as console.table just to show the docker output from .ps1 file to the NodeJS/JavaScript.
